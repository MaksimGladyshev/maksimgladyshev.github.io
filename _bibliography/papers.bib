abstract = {Tracing and analysing the responsibility for unsafe outcomes of actors' decisions in multi-agent settings have been studied in recent years. These studies often focus on deterministic scenarios and assume that the unsafe outcomes for which actors can be held responsible are actually realized. This paper considers a broader notion of responsibility where unsafe outcomes are not necessarily realized, but their probabilities are unacceptably high. We present a logic combining strategic, probabilistic and temporal primitives designed to express concepts such as the risk of an undesirable outcome and being responsible for exceeding a risk threshold in one-shot games. We demonstrate that the proposed logic is (weakly) complete, decidable and has an efficient model-checking procedure. Finally, we define a probabilistic notion of responsibility and study its formal properties in the proposed logic setting.}

abstract="In this paper we discuss how causal models can be used for modeling multi-agent interaction in complex organizational settings, where agents' decisions may depend on other agents' decisions as well as the environment. We demonstrate how to reason about the dynamics of such models using concurrent game structures where agents can change the organisational setting and thereby their decision dependencies. In such concurrent game structure, agents can choose to modify their reactions on other agents' decisions and on the environment by intervening on their part of a causal model. We propose a generalized notion of interventions in causal models that allow us to model and reason about the dynamics of agents' dependencies in a multi-agent system. Finally, we discuss how to model uncertainty and reason about agents' responsibility concerning their dependencies and thereby their choices.",
