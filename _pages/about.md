I am a PhD candidate under supervision of <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=J1ThCVcAAAAJ'>Natasha Alechina</a>, <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rvG4n98AAAAJ'>Mehdi Dastani</a>, and <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q2LqE3QAAAAJ'>Dragan Doder</a>.

In my research I focus on using logical methods for artificial intelligence and multi-agent systems. These methods allow one to reason about such things as causality, knowledge, strategic power and time.
